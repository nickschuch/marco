Tutum
=====

For containers to be discovered they need to be run with the following criteria.
* A DOMAIN environment variable
* A web port exposed eg. 80 or 8080

You can then run the following command (with your Tutum credentials):

```bash
$ marco --backend="tutum" --tutum-user=XXXXXX --tutum-key=XXXXXX
```
